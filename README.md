# Android BottomSheetBehavior Sample
A very simple example of the BottomSheetBehavior feature introduced with Android Support Library 23.2 (http://android-developers.blogspot.de/2016/02/android-support-library-232.html)

The sample simply added a View, which can be collapsed:
![Collapsed](/image/collapsed.png)

or expanded:
![Collapsed](/image/expanded.png)

The relevants files are:
- ScrollingActivity.java
- activity_scrolling.xml

*Please be aware that the layout with the BottomSheetBehavior has to be a direct child of the CoordinatorLayout!*
